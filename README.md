# 2D-Filter-OpenCV

1. ƒ∞mplement the median filter for grayscale images as detailed in our lecture slides. You are not allowed to use OpenCV‚Äôs or any other image/signal processing API‚Äôs built-in median filtering function for this part.
Once you implement your own median filtering function, you will apply it to the provided
test image. The provided test image (noisyImage.jpg) will be corrupted with salt-andpepper
noise and your median filter (with 5x5 window size) will be used to denoise it. You
will then apply OpenCV‚Äôs built-in median filter to the same test image. Your median filter
output must match OpenCV‚Äôs median filter output perfectly. If the difference between
these two output images has any non-zero pixels, this is an instant fail, meaning you will
get zero points for this question. Hint: OpenCV‚Äôs median filter uses BORDER_REPLICATE
padding.

2. ƒ∞n academic and industrial image restoration / reconstruction algorithm
development works, there is always a need to measure how well an algorithm performs.
For this purpose, it is quite common to gather a set of test images (called originals, goldens
or ground truth images) and corrupt these images (for example, by adding noise) with the
degradation for which the restoration algorithm is being developed. These corrupted
images then become the test set on which the algorithm is tested. The key observation is
this: Since these test images are obtained by corrupting the originals, the algorithm‚Äôs
outputs can be compared against the original images to see how well the algorithm
works (how well it reconstructs). This is how we measure the performance of restoration
/ reconstruction algorithms.

Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a metric (in decibels) that can be used to measure how
good a reconstructed (for example, denoised ‚Äì as you did in Question 1) image matches
the original (uncorrupted, golden) image.

Here, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the average (over all pixels) of the squared differences
between two images. For 8-bit grayscale images, ùëÖ is the maximum intensity value, that
is 255. In case of denoising, one image is the original (clean, ground truth) and the other
image is the output of the denoising algorithm. Since there are multiple different
definitions of PSNR with very minor differences, we will use OpenCV‚Äôs PSNR calculation
function. To see how it is used check out the provided Python script.   

For this question, you will use OpenCV‚Äôs built-in (1) 5x5 box filter, (2) zero mean, 7x7
Gaussian function, (3) 5x5 median filters to denoise the noisy test image. Once you are
done, you should have four outputs:
1. Your own median filter output   
2. OpenCV‚Äôs box filter output    
3. OpenCV‚Äôs Gaussian filter output    
4. OpenCV‚Äôs median filter output     

You will be provided with the clean version (original.jpg) of the noisy test image to use as
the ground truth. Using OpenCV‚Äôs PSNR calculation function, you will compute four PSNR
values for these four denoised output images. Note that the PSNR values for (1) and (4)
must be the same.

What are the PSNR values? According to PSNR, which filter performs the best?

3. Modify your median filter implementation to make
it center weighted as we discussed in the class. That is, instead of using each pixel value
only once to compute the median, this modified version will count the center pixel 3 times
(by replicating it 3 times in the sorted array), making your median filter ‚Äúcenter weighted‚Äù
(putting more weight on the center pixel).
Once you are done, you should have five outputs: The four outputs from the previous
question, plus your own center weighted median filter output. Using OpenCV‚Äôs PSNR
calculation function, you will compute five PSNR values for these five denoised output
images.

What are the PSNR values? According to PSNR, which filter performs the best?
